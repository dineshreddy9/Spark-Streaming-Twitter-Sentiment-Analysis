Implemented the following framework using Apache SparkStreaming, ElasticSearch and Kibana. The framework performs sentiment analysis of particular hashtags in twitter data in real time. For example, we want to do the sentiment analysis for all the tweets for #guncontrolnow and show their
(e.g.,positive, neutral, negative) statistics in Kibana. For this, first I got the tweets via scrapper (stream.py). Next, I had written a sentiment analysis program to predict sentiment of the tweet message. Finally, I had visualized the findings using ElasticSearch/Kibana.
Scrapper -> Sentiment Analyzer/Common topic finder -> Visualizer (ElasticSearch/Kibana)
